4 Player Chess:
Rules: 
2 v 2, once any player on a team is mated --> game ends
pawn promote on 11th rank
red, then clockwise
Some observations:
Castling is harder --> performing an earlier castle may be important
 - an early castle break can occur w/ moving a king's pawn when the player clockwise (after you) already moved his 
   - on the flipside, this also means, you should not move king's pawn if the previous player moved his
Teammate's pieces count as protection for taking pieces
Turn based system means you can get free pieces if your teammate checks, and then you position yourself to take a pieces
  from the checked player. 
Checkmates only occur when it gets to the player in checkmate (allows partner to move and prevent)
An interesting opening trap: move king pawn, next player moves queen pawn (maybe necessary idk), teammate moves king pawn
 - if the other player moves king pawn --> game ends (queen takes queen, teammate bishop to protect)


Notes on 4PlayerChess Qt Application:
Checkmates aren't properly handled (nor are checks)
 - checks: algorithm.py line 938
 - checkmates: either make functions in the bitboard (don't do) or come up with a check that uses prev defined functions
   (maybe inefficient?)
Pawn Promotion not encoded
En-passant --> needs code
FEN4 notation seems to be the 4 player chess movement notation
There might already be starting code to quickly convert chess.com moves to this and vice versa
 - some functions in the algorithm class, can we link this with chess.com in some way?
GameState handled by nodes in a tree representing the states of the game (allows history and variations)
Game Loop:
- Create new game:
  - generate default board state in algorithm (and init bitmap board)
- Repeat Forever:
  - wait for actions in gui (this is what we will need to reroute)
    - when made, go to make move function in algorithm (which handles the move and sets next player)

Things to consider for evaluation:
Transposition Table: Hash positions w/ evaluations so to prevent reuse. Interesting if using alpha-beta pruning.
Game-Phase Separation?
 - Early Game: Does it matter (besides preventing early mates?)
 - Mid Game: Likely very important
    - how to handle mobility vs. king safety, likely very important
 - End Game: How does the ability to potentially have two moves before one opponent get a turn change material needed to win?
Tempo VS. Material

Things to try:
NegaMax instead of Minimax, NegaScout instead of NegaMax (iterative deepening + PV nodes in Transposition Tables)
